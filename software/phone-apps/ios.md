#### Social

- **RSS reader:** NetNewsWire
- **Mastodon:** Ice Cubes / Mastoot

> Toot! looks like really nice Mastadon client with lots of features, but it's a paid app. If you like it, support the dev by purchasing it!
> 
> Mammoth looks quite good with a "minimalist" look, but pushes their Mammoth Gold subscription and is a little buggy in my experience.

- **Lemmy:** Mlem
- **Pixelfed:** *official app* / Impressia
- **YT frontend:** BluePlayer / Yattee / *Invidious web app* 

> Yattee seems like the most recommended one online, but I couldn’t get it to work. Your mileage may vary. Seems to be feature-rich and has great UI.
> 
> BluePlayer seems like a cool project but the UI is difficult to navigate. Very customisable, however. It’s a fun option.
> 
> For most people, I would recommend going to your preferred invidious instance, click the share icon, and select “add to home screen” to turn it into a web app.
