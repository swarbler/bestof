# iOS Apps

- **browser** 
	- **standard:** *Safari* 
	- **extension support:** [Orion by Kagi](https://apps.apple.com/app/orion-browser-by-kagi/id1484498200)
	- **more customisable:** [SnowHaze](https://apps.apple.com/app/snowhaze/id1121026941)

> As Apple does not allow browsers to use engines other than WebKit, most browsers on iOS are effectively reskins of Safari. If you like the look of other iOS browsers, be noted that they all use WebKit under the hood and most do not support extensions.
> 
> [Firefox](https://apps.apple.com/app/firefox-private-safe-browser/id989804926) (and [Firefox Focus](https://apps.apple.com/app/firefox-focus-privacy-browser/id1055677337)) are both options if you want Firefox Sync but don't offer many additional features over Safari and lacks extension support.
> 
> I have recommended Orion as an option as it, like Firefox Focus, has a built-in content blocker. It uniquely supports both Chrome and Firefox extensions, and in my opinion, is a pretty decent browser overall.
> 
> SnowHaze is also recommended as it seems like an excellent browser for iOS. it has numerous security and privacy settings and includes a content blocker. However, it does not feature extension support.

- **email client:** *Apple Mail*

#### Photos

- **camera app**
	- **standard:** *Camera*
	- **better:** [Halide](https://apps.apple.com/app/halide-mark-ii-pro-camera/id885697368) *($59.99 one-time purchase / $9.99 monthly / $19.99 yearly)*
- **image gallery:** *Photos* 
- **photo editor:** [Darkroom](https://apps.apple.com/app/darkroom-photo-video-editor/id953286746)

> If you want a more advanced camera app, my pick for a free option would be to use [Obscura](https://apps.apple.com/app/obscura-pro-camera/id1579306989). Most features are available in the free version, and the only major feature you are missing is video recording.

#### Audio

- **music player:** [Foobar2000](https://apps.apple.com/app/foobar2000/id1072807669) / [Doppler](https://apps.apple.com/app/doppler-mp3-flac-player/id1468459747) *($9)*
- **Navidrome client:** [Amperfy](https://apps.apple.com/app/amperfy-music/id1530145038) / [substreamer](https://apps.apple.com/app/substreamer/id1012991665)
- **voice recorder:** *Voice Memos* / [Shure Motiv Audio](https://apps.apple.com/app/motiv-audio/id938264337)

#### Productivity

- **todo.txt:** [2do.txt](https://apps.apple.com/app/2do-txt/id1597652888) / [Swiftodo](https://apps.apple.com/app/swiftodo-task-list-for-todo.txt/id1073798440) *($4.99)*
- **calendar:** *Calendar*
- **notes:** [Bear](https://apps.apple.com/app/bear-markdown-notes/id1016366447)

> other good calendar apps include [Across](https://apps.apple.com/app/across-modern-calendar/id6444851827), [Creme](https://apps.apple.com/app/creme-planner-agenda/id6502579791), and [Calendar 366](https://apps.apple.com/app/calendar-366-events-tasks/id1265892516) *($9.99)*

#### Social

- **RSS reader:** [NetNewsWire](https://apps.apple.com/app/netnewswire-rss-reader/id1480640210)
- **Mastodon:** [Ice Cubes](https://apps.apple.com/app/ice-cubes-for-mastodon/id6444915884) / [Mastoot](https://apps.apple.com/app/mastoot/id1501485410?l=en)

> [Toot!](https://apps.apple.com/app/toot-for-mastodon/id1229021451) *($3.99)* looks like really nice Mastadon client with lots of features, but it's a paid app. If you like it, support the dev by purchasing it.
> 
> [Mammoth](https://apps.apple.com/app/mammoth-for-mastodon/id1667573899) looks quite good with a "minimalist" look, but pushes their Mammoth Gold subscription and is a little buggy in my experience.

- **Lemmy:** [Mlem](https://apps.apple.com/app/mlem-for-lemmy/id6450543782)
- **Pixelfed:** *official app* / [Impressia](https://apps.apple.com/app/impressia-for-pixelfed/id1663543216)
- **YT frontend:** [BluePlayer](https://apps.apple.com/app/blueplayer-video-music-player/id1564931348) / [Yattee](https://apps.apple.com/app/yattee/id1595136629) / *Invidious web app* 

> Yattee seems like the most recommended one online, but I couldn’t get it to work. Your mileage may vary. Seems to be feature-rich and has great UI.
> 
> BluePlayer seems like a cool project but the UI is difficult to navigate. Very customisable, however. It’s a fun option.
> 
> For most people, I would recommend going to your preferred invidious instance, click the share icon, and select “add to home screen” to turn it into a web app.
