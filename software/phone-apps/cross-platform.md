# Cross-Platform Apps

#### Documents

- **notes:** [Joplin](https://joplinapp.org/) / [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) / [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) / [Notesnook](https://notesnook.com/) / *others*
- **office suite:** [Collabora Office](https://www.collaboraonline.com/)

> Joplin, Logseq, and Notesnook are open-source whereas Obsidian is closed. All of them offer syncing options. Logseq interestingly doesn't use a folder-based structure like Obsidian does, but both use .md files.
> 
> Joplin and Notesnook don't use .md files or similar, but the latter allows you to export your notes as text files (.txt, .pdf, .html, and .md). There is a Joplin plugin that allows you to save notes as .md files called "Save as .md". This feature should really be built in though.
> 
> Other note-taking apps are also great, it just depends on your personal preference. The ones I have listed here are options that I have tried that have good UI, syncing between devices, and Markdown support in some form or another.
