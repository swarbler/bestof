# Controllers

> The PS5 Dualsense controller is also an option as the haptics are fantastic and is a generally high-quality controller.

> HE sticks = hall-effect joysticks (more reliable than traditional potentiometer sticks)
> TMR sticks = "Tunneling Magnetoresistance", or electromagnetic joysticks (lower power and more precise than HE sticks)
> adjustable stick tension = you are able to change how much tension there are in the joysticks
> 
> HE triggers = hall-effect triggers
> w/ trigger lock = HE triggers, you can switch between analog triggers and hair triggers (for competitive FPS)
> 
> microswitch face buttons are clicky and are mechanical, whereas membrane face buttons are quiet and soft
> 
> clicky d-pads...click...and "squishy" d-pads do not
