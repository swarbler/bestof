## Binoculars

- **budget:** Celestron Cometron *(7x50)*
- **standard:** Vortex Diamondback HD / Monarch M5 / Nikon Prostaff P7
	- **smaller:** *8x32 or 8x42*
	- **larger:** *10x42*

> The Vortex Crossfire HD are a bit cheaper than the Diamondback for a reduction in quality. If the Diamondback is too expensive, the Crossfire HD is a good option.
> 
> The Prostaff P3 lacks dielectric coatings compared to the P7, meaning image quality is reduced. If you find it for much cheaper in your region, it might be a good option.
> 
> The Monarch 5 also lacks dielectric coatings as well compared to the M5, which mean that image quality is reduced. Again, if you find it for significantly cheaper, it might be a decent option.
