# Bike

> Bicycles come in all shapes and sizes, **the "best" one is different to everyone. Ideally find a local bike shop and find one that suits you best.** Someone on Lemmy mentioned Omafiets as a good comfortable option for a bike, take that what you will. Finding bicycles used is also a good way to save money.

> These e-bikes are well-reviewed online. Also note that this list is more focused on commuter bikes rather than anything like mountain bikes. **If you like a different e-bike, that's fine by me.** There are definitely other good e-bikes, so be sure to do your research and, ideally, **try them out in a local bike shop before you decide to purchase.**
> 
> **NOTE THAT E-BIKES ARE EXPENSIVE. PLEASE GET A GOOD BIKE LOCK AND DON'T LOSE IT!**
