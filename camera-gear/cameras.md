## Interchangeable Lens Cameras

> buying **USED** will give you MUCH better deals!

> note: prices below are BODY ONLY *(i.e. w/o kit lenses)*

### Sony

#### Hybrid

- **used options:** A6000 / A6100 / A6300
- **under $1000:** A6400 *(~~$899~~ $748)*
- **under $1500:** A6700 *($1398)*
- **over $2000:** A7C II *($2198)* / A7 IV *($2498)*

- **under $2000:** FX30 *($1599)*
- **over $3000:** A7S III *(~~$3499~~ $3198)*

> The ZV-E10 II *($998)* is overpriced for what it is in my opinion
> 
> The FX3 *($3898)* has the same sensor as the A7S III but has a cinema-focused body, meaning things like no EVF and mounting holes and more video-focused software

#### Photo

- **under $3000:** A7R IV *(~~$3198~~ $2998)*
- **under $4000:** A7R V *($3898)*

### Panasonic Lumix

#### M43

- **under $1000:** GX85 *(~$500 used)*
- **under $2000:** G9 II *(~~$1899~~ $1697)*

> G85 *($899)* is weather sealed alternative to the GX85 with a larger DSLR-style grip

#### Full-Frame

- **under $1500:** S9 *(~~$1497~~ $1397)*
- **under $2000:** S5 II *(~~$1999~~ $1497)* or IIX *(~~$2499~~ $2197)*
- **under $3500:** S1R II *($3297)*

### Fujifilm

#### Hybrid

- **under $1000:** X-T30 II *($899)*
- **under $1500:** X-T50 *($1399)*
- **under $2000:** X-T5 *($1699)*

> The X-M5 *($799)* is comparable to the X-T30 II in image quality but lacks an EVF and is much smaller with a less substantial grip. It also has fewer buttons and dials than the X-T30 II. Since it is newer, however, it has a few more features such as a larger buffer for burst photography and more advanced AF. 

>  The X-T4 *(~$1100 used)* can also be a very good deal

#### Video

- **under $1500:** X-S20 *($1299)*

- **under $4000:** R5 II *(~~$4299~~ $3999)*

#### Video

- **under $1000:** R50 *($579)*
- **over $3000:** C70 *(~$3500 used)*

> The Canon M50 *(~$350 used)* is similar to the R50 but uses a dead mount

### Nikon

- **under $1000:** Z50 *($599)* / Z30 *(~~$709~~ $609)*
- **around $2000:** Z6 III *(~~$2499~~ $2196)* / Zf *(~~$1996~~ $1796)*
	- *Z6 III is the best price/performance*
	- *Zf is more fun and a bit smaller*
- **over $3000:** Z8 *(~~$3999~~ $3396)*

> Zfc *(~~$1096~~ $996)* is similar to the Z30 II but has an EVF. However, it has no weather sealing!
