## Monitors

- **24” 1080p:** AOC 24G4 *(180hz IPS)*
- **27" 1440p** 
	- **cheaper:** Dell G2724D *(144hz IPS)
	- **standard:** Gigabyte M27Q *(165hz IPS)* / LG 27GP850 *(180hz IPS)*
	- **better:** LG 27GR95QE *(240hz OLED)*
	- **mini-LED:** Xiaomi G Pro 27i
- **32” 4K** 
	- **standard:** Gigabyte M32U / LG 32GR93U *(144hz IPS)*
	- **better:** *any 240hz QD-OLED, depends on pricing
- **34" ultrawide** 
	- **standard:** Gigabyte M34WQ *(144hz IPS)*
	- **better:** Odyssey OLED G8 *(240hz QD-OLED)*
 - **49" ultrawide:** Evnia 49M2C8900L *(240hz QD-OLED)*

> If you prefer WOLED, the LG 32GS95UE and LG 34GS95QE are good 32" 4K and 34" ultrawide 240hz WOLED monitors respectively

> The Gigabyte FO32U2P is a unique 32" 4K 240hz QD-OLED monitor in that it has DP 2.1 support for some future proofing. The FO32U2 is the same monitor but a little cheaper and without DP 2.1

#### Accessories

- **monitor arm:** Fully Jarvis *(up to 17 lbs)* / Ergotron LX *(7 to 25 lbs)* / Ergotron HX (*28 to 45 lbs)*
- **webcam:** Logitech Brio 505 *($99)*
- **KVM switch:** Level1Techs *($ depends on model)*
- **screenbar** 
	- **cheaper:** Xiaomi *($59)*
	- **better:** BenQ Screenbar Halo *($179)*

## Projectors

- **cheaper:** *used BenQ, Epson, or other name brand projectors*
	- *Facebook Marketplace or similar*
	- *refurbished projectors*
	- *old school projectors*
- **standard:** BenQ HT2050A
- **upgrade:** BenQ HT3560 / Epson 3800
	- *the BenQ is a little bit sharper (true 4K)*
	- *the Epson is brighter with better contrast*
- **better upgrade:** Epson 5050UB

> The Epson LS11000 is sharper than the 5050UB, but it will cost significantly more and has worse contrast. The LS12000 has an even higher asking price the LS11000, but has better contrast and IQ overall. Both are not very nice for your wallet…

> Happrun H1 / Onoayo AY2PRO seem to be good no-name brand projectors, but I would not recommend them as they are mass-produced e-waste that need to replaced within a few months

#### Accessories

- **screen:** Silver Ticket 


> Elite Screens also make good projector screens, but Silver Ticket is usually a bit better on price

{: .warning }
Do NOT buy the thin bezel screens, they are ridiculously overpriced! It also makes it a lot more difficult to align the projector correctly…
