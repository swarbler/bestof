> If you prefer WOLED, the LG 32GS95UE and LG 34GS95QE are good 32" 4K and 34" ultrawide 240hz WOLED monitors respectively

> The Gigabyte FO32U2P is a unique 32" 4K 240hz QD-OLED monitor in that it has DP 2.1 support for some future proofing. The FO32U2 is the same monitor but a little cheaper and without DP 2.1

#### Accessories

- **screenbar** 
	- **cheaper:** Xiaomi *($59)*
	- **better:** BenQ Screenbar Halo *($179)*

## Projectors

- **cheaper:** *used BenQ, Epson, or other name brand projectors*
	- *Facebook Marketplace or similar*
	- *refurbished projectors*
	- *old school projectors*

> Happrun H1 / Onoayo AY2PRO seem to be good no-name brand projectors, but I would not recommend them as they are mass-produced e-waste that need to replaced within a few months

- **under $1000:** BenQ HT2050A *($749)*
- **under $2000:** BenQ HT3560 *($1699)* / Epson 3800 *($1699)*

> The BenQ is a little bit sharper as it is true 4K, but the Epson is brighter with better contrast

- **under $3000:** Epson 5050UB *($2999)*

> The Epson LS11000 *($3999)* is sharper than the 5050UB, but it will cost significantly more and has worse contrast. The LS12000 *($4999)* has an even higher asking price the LS11000, but has better contrast and IQ overall. Both are not very nice for your wallet…

#### Accessories

- **screen:** Silver Ticket *($ depends on size)*


> Elite Screens also make good projector screens, but Silver Ticket is usually a bit better on price

> do **NOT** buy the thin bezel screens, they are ridiculously overpriced! It also makes it a lot more difficult to align the projector correctly…
