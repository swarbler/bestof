# External Drives

*$ depends on storage capacity*
- **USB drives** 
	- **compact:** Kingston DataTraveller Micro / Samsung Fit Plus / Sandisk Ultra Fit
	- **standard:** Kingston DataTraveller / Samsung Bar Plus / Sandisk Extreme Pro
- **portable SSD:** Samsung T7 Shield
- **portable SSD enclosure (TB4):** Acasis TB-401 *(~~$89~~ $79)* / TB-405 *(~~$89~~ $79)* / TB-405 Pro *(~~$109~~ $94)*

> The OWC Express 1M2 *($119)* is also a good option and is bit more expensive than the Acasis.

> The TB-401 is silver whereas the TB-405 and TB-405 Pro are dark grey with more stripes for dissipating heat. The TB-405 Pro has a cooling fan whereas the others do not.
> 
> The TB-501 Pro *($299)* is TB5 and is similar to the TB-405 Pro, with a cooling fan and a dark grey body. It is much more expensive than TB4 enclosures. Most people do not have TB5 devices or cables, so the extra cost is not worth it for most.
