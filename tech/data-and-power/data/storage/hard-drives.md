	- *others are fine as long as they are from a reputable brand*
- **PCiE 4.0 (higher performance, but overpriced + most don't need it)** 
	- Crucial T500 *($79 for 500GB, **$99 for 1TB**, ~~$168~~ $154 for 2TB, $340 for 4TB)*
	- Samsung 990 Pro *(**~~$127~~ $99 for 1TB**, ~~$199~~ $169 for 2TB, ~~$374~~ $299 for 4TB)*

	- Samsung 9100 Pro *(**$199 for 1TB**, $299 for 2TB, $549 for 4TB)*

> The Sabrent Rocket 4 *(**$99 for 1TB**, $199 for 2TB, $399 for 4TB)*, Rocket 4 Plus *($64 for 500GB, **~~$299~~ $119 for 1TB**, ~~$499~~ $219 for 2TB, $499 for 4TB, ~~$1499~~ $1199 for 8TB)*, and Rocket 5 *(**~~$269~~ $189 for 1TB**, ~~$439~~ $339 for 2TB, ~~$899~~ $729 for 4TB)* are all decent options, but they cost more than similar drives and aren't as reliable or have as good of a warranty as brands such as Samsung and WD.
