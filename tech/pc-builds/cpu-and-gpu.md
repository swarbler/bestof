# CPU and GPU

> I did not include CPUs on dead platforms as this list is meant to be future proof. If you buy into a dead platform now, you will be unable to upgrade to a newer CPU in the future.
> 
> However, good older CPUs for an budget build include the Ryzen 5 5600, the Core i3-12100F or i5-12400F, and the Ryzen 7 5700X3D. A decent budget GPU would ideally be the B580, but if it is out of stock, the RX 7600 or the RTX 4060 are good alternatives
> 
> I did not include Intel's 13th and 14th generation CPUs due to their microcode issues resulting in CPUs going dead. Also, they are on a dead platform.
> 
> Intel's newest Arrow Lake CPUs actually had a performance regression in gaming compared to last gen and you have to get a new motherboard with the LGA 1851 socket, and those are expensive.

> AMD's Zen 5 processors (9xxx series) underperformed despite the higher price compared to equivalent Zen 4 processors (7xxx series), but if you find them for a similar price, they are worth it as they are a lot better in power efficiency

- **RAM:** 6000MT/s CL30 DDR5 *(best option for AM5)*
- **SSDs:** [view section on SSDs](https://swarbler.github.io/bestof/tech/data-and-power/data/storage/hard-drives#ssds)

## 1080p / 1440p

- **CPU:** Ryzen 5 7600 *(~~$229~~ ~$190)* or 7600X *(~~$299~~ ~$220)*
- **GPU:** RX 6800 XT
- **power supply:** *at least 650W*

> The Ryzen 5 7600 and 7600X can be cooled with their included stock coolers

> The RX 7700 XT underperforms in comparison to the RX 6800 XT. If you're able to find the RX 7700 XT for a lot cheaper than it might be worth it

## 1440p / 4K

- **CPU:** Ryzen 7 7700X *(~~$399~~ ~$270)*
- **GPU:** RX 7800 XT / RTX 4070 Super
	- **better:** RX 7900 XT / RTX 4070 Ti Super
- **power supply:** *at least 750W*

> If ASRock Steel Legend is out of stock, the Gigabyte B650 Aorus Elite AX V2 is a good alternative

> The RX 7900 GRE sits in between RX 7800 XT and RX 7900 XT and is a very good value

## Best for Gaming Battlestations

- **CPU:** Ryzen 7 7800X3D *($449)*
- **GPU:** RX 7900 XT / RTX 4070 Ti Super
	- **better:** RX 7900 XTX / RTX 4080 Super
- **power supply:** *at least 850W*

> If you find the 9800X3D *($479)* for a reasonable price, it is better than the 7800X3D. It might not always be in stock, however.

## Best for Productivity Workhorses

- **CPU:** Ryzen 9 7900X *(~~$549~~ ~$350)* or 7950X *(~~$699~~ ~$480)*
- **GPU:** RX 7900 XT / RTX 4070 Ti Super
	- **better:** RX 7900 XTX / RTX 4080 Super
- **power supply:** *at least 1000W*
