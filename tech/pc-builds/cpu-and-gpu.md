# CPU and GPU

> I did not include CPUs on dead platforms as this list is meant to be future proof. If you buy into a dead platform now, you will be unable to upgrade to a newer CPU in the future.
> 
> However, good older CPUs for an budget build include the Ryzen 5 5600, the Core i3-12100F or i5-12400F, and the Ryzen 7 5700X3D.
> 
> I did not include Intel's 13th and 14th generation CPUs due to their microcode issues resulting in CPUs going dead. Also, they are on a dead platform.
> 
> Intel's newest Arrow Lake CPUs actually had a performance regression in gaming compared to last gen and you have to get a new motherboard with the LGA 1851 socket, which is expensive. 
> 
> AMD's Zen 5 processors underperformed despite the higher price compared to equivalent Zen 4 processors.

- **RAM:** 6000MT/s CL30 DDR5 *(best option for AM5)*

## 1080p / 1440p

- **CPU:** Ryzen 5 7600 or 7600X
- **GPU:** RX 6800 XT
- **power supply:** *at least 650W*

> The 7600 / 7600X can be cooled with their stock coolers


> The RX 7700 XT underperforms in comparison to the RX 6800 XT. If you're able to find the RX 7700 XT for a lot cheaper than it could be worth it

## 1440p / 4K

- **CPU:** Ryzen 7 7700 or 7700X
- **GPU:** RX 7800 XT / RTX 4070 Super
	- **better:** RX 7900 XT / RTX 4070 Ti Super
- **power supply:** *at least 750W*

> If ASRock Steel Legend is out of stock, the Gigabyte B650 Aorus Elite AX V2 is a good alternative

> If you find the RTX 4070 for a lot cheaper than the Super model, then get that

> The RX 7900 GRE sits in between RX 7800 XT and RX 7900 XT and is a very good value

## Best for Gaming Battlestations

- **CPU:** Ryzen 7 7800X3D *(or 9800X3D if you find it in stock)*
- **GPU:** RX 7900 XT / RTX 4070 Ti Super
	- **better:** RX 7900 XTX / RTX 4080 Super
- **power supply:** *at least 850W*

> If you find the RTX 4080 for a lot cheaper than the Super model, then get that

## Best for Productivity Workhorses

- **CPU:** Ryzen 9 7900X or 7950X
- **GPU:** RX 7900 XT / RTX 4070 Ti Super
	- **better:** RX 7900 XTX / RTX 4080 Super
- **power supply:** *at least 850W*

> If you find the RTX 4080 for a lot cheaper than the Super model, then get that
