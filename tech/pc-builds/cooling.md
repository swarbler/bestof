# Cooling

## CPU Coolers

#### Air Coolers

- **standard:** Thermalright Phantom Spirit
- **low-profile** 
	- **36/43/53mm height:** Thermalright AXP90-X36/43/53
	- **67mm height:** Thermalright AXP-120-X67

> The Peerless Assasin is very similar to the Phantom Spirit and quite close to performance, so it's a good alternative if the Phantom Spirit is out of stock.
> 
> The Scythe Fuma 3 is also a very good performer as well, and if you find it for a lot cheaper than the Phantom Spirit, it might be a good value.
> 
> Noctua coolers are marginally better than the competition, but unless you are running a very hot processor such as the 13900K or 14900K, it is not worth the >$100 price increase.

#### AIOs

*larger radiator gives you better cooling*
- **standard:** *they all perform similarly, pick the one you like the best/at the best price in your region*
	- **good ones include, but not limited to:**
		- Lian Li Galahad II Trinity Performance
		- Thermalright Frozen Notte
		- Corsair iCUE Link
		- Deepcool LT520 or LT720
		- be quiet! Pure Loop 2
		- NZXT Kraken
- **higher performance:** Arctic Liquid Freezer III 

> The Liquid Freezer III has a thicker radiator that may not fit in all cases

## Fans

- **120mm:** Arctic P12 Max
- **140mm:** Arctic P14

> Other fans such as the Phanteks T-30 and Noctuas are also very high performing, but the price is not as good as the Arctic fans. They are a bit quieter at higher fan speeds, but most people won't run their fans at 100%!
