- **ATX:** Be Quiet / Corsair RMx or RMx Shift / EVGA G6 or G7 / Seasonic Focus GX or Prime PX

> Corsair RMe series uses cheaper components and, according to online reviews, have a problem with coil whine. The RMx Shift series is similar to the RMx series but with ATX 3.0 compatibility.
> 
> The Seasonic Focus GX and Prime PX series are both very good, but the Prime is *very slightly* more efficient than the Focus. You will have a good experience with both.
> 
> EVGA's G3 is made by Superflower, the G5 is made by FSP, and the G6 and G7 is made by Seasonic. The G6 and G7 is best designed out of all of them. 

- **SFX:** SF750 *(smaller)*
- **SFX-L:** Loki 1000W Platinum *(larger + more powerful)*
- **Flex-ATX:** ?
