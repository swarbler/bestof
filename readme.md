# bestof - the best things!

## what is this?

bestof is a repository of the best things in each product category, frequently updated whenever a new thing is released or I find out there's an even better thing! [(view screenshots)](screenshots.md)

## background

I've been working on this for many years now, starting off with a PowerPoint detailing which things are the best in their respective categories. The idea was that I would never have to do any of the researching when I actually needed to buy anything. 

I later moved everything from the PowerPoint to a more organised system of different folders and markdown files, which makes it much easier to find everything. Fast forward to now, this repository of all sorts of things is significantly larger!

- other github repos also exist as well, they're all very good!

## how I decide the things

- **personal experience** 
- **reputable online reviews**
- **significant consensus online forums**
- **feature set and (relative) price**

I try to balance my own experiences and opinions with online reviews and forums when deciding which things are the best things, as well as taking into account the feature set and price of the thing.

## why isn't \[X thing] the best one?

**the main reasons include but are not limited to:**
- I have decided that \[X thing] is too expensive, lacking in features, or has a fatal flaw that is a dealbreaker
- \[X thing] is not safe and is dangerous (e.g. no-name USB chargers and powerbanks)
- There was very little information surrounding that product category
- This product category is incredibly subject to personal preference and this is simply the thing that I prefer

## you missed out on \[X category of things], what gives?

- I have decided not to research \[X category of things] because I don't want to look at a bunch of pictures of \[X category of things] (e.g. underwear)
- There may not neccesarily be a "best thing" in \[X category of things] and it doesn't really matter which one you buy as long as it's from a reputable manufacturer
- I am not the target demographic for \[X category of things] and I am not the right person to ask for recommendations for \[X category of things]!
