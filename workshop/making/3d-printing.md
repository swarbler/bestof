# 3D Printing

## FDM Printers

***personal ranking***
1. **Voron** - good hardware, very upgradeable + repairable, very open-source 
	- *best option if you're fine with building it yourself*
2. **Prusa** - good hardware, very upgradeable + repairable
	- *gold standard for quality + customer support* 
3. **Qidi** - well-priced CoreXY printers with some interesting features, prints engineering filaments out of the box
	- *the Qidi Q1 Pro is an amazing value and very competitive with Bambu Lab!*
4. **Sovol** - SV06 ACE is a Prusa clone, SV08 is a Voron kit, very repairable + open
5. **Bambu Lab** - good hardware and some parts are replaceable, but very closed ecosystem
	- *Bambu Lab has locked down on third-party software!*
6. **Creality** - meh hardware for the price, may not be as reliable as other brands. 
	- *ecosystem is also quite closed, but less so than Bambu*

*Elegoo’s Centauri Carbon recently released, could possibly be an incredible value but wait for independent reviews to release*

### Prusa

- **smaller bed-slinger:** Mini+ *($429 for kit, $459 for semi-assembled)*
- **standard bed-slinger:** MK4S *($729 for kit, $999 for pre-assembled, +$270 for MMU3)*
- **upgrade CoreXY:** Core One  *($949 for kit, $1,199 for pre-assembled)*

> There no real reason why you should get the Prusa Mini+ unless you want a small printer/the cheapest printer from Prusa. Other options in this price range offer far better value (Sovol, Qidi, and Bambu Lab all have good options)

> The multi-material unit (MMU3) can be purchased separately for $359 preassembled or $329 as a kit ($299 if you exclude print your own parts)

### Qidi

- **cheaper CoreXY:** Qidi Q1 Pro *(~~$599~~ $449)*
- **larger CoreXY:** Qidi Plus 4 *(~~$999~~ $799)*

### Sovol

- **cheaper bed-slinger:** SV06 ACE *(~~$299~~ $279)*
- **larger bed-slinger:** SV06 Plus ACE *(~~$349~~ $299)*
- **larger CoreXY:** SV08 *(~~$599~~ $569)*

### Bambu Lab

- **smaller bed-slinger:** A1 Mini  *(~~$299~~ $239, ~~$459~~ $389 for AMS lite combo)*
- **cheaper bed-slinger:** A1 *(~~$399~~ $379, ~~$559~~ $529 for AMS lite combo)*
- **standard CoreXY:** P1P  *(~~$699~~ $539)*
	- **with enclosure:** P1S  *(~~$699~~ $649, ~~$949~~ $849 for AMS combo)*
- **upgrade CoreXY:** X1 Carbon  *($1199, $1449 for AMS combo)*

> **Bambu Lab has restricted access to its printers, so you are unable to use third-party software without changing to "Developer Mode" (LAN only mode) in firmware after v4.0.0.0!** 
> 
> If you want to continue using a Bambu Handy-like app with Bambu printers, I recommend the "Bambu Companion" app (unfortunately iOS only) with Tailscale. It works surprisingly well!

> The multi-material unit for the P1 and X1 printers (AMS) can be purchased separately for ~~$349~~ $319. You are able to connect 4 AMS units to print 16 colours at a time! The one for the A1 series (AMS Lite) can be purchased separately for $269.
> 
> Bambu Lab has also released an upgraded multi-material unit (AMS 2 Pro) for $349 with built-in filament drying and better access to the filament tubes. They have also released a single-filament multi-material unit (AMS HT) for $149 that has hotter drying temperatures and a display for viewing the humidity of the filament. You are able to pair 4 AMS 2 Pro units with 8 AMS HT units to print with 24 colours at a time!

### Creality

- **budget bed-slinger:** Ender 3 V3 SE *($219)* or KE *($299)*

> The Ender 3 V3 KE can print at higher temperatures + has a linear rail for the X-axis + has Klipper firmware

- **upgrade CoreXY:** K2 Plus *($1299, $1499 for CFS combo)*

> The multi-material unit (CFS) can be purchased separately for $319

### Elegoo

- **cheaper CoreXY:** Centauri Carbon *($299)*

> The Centauri *($199)* is even cheaper alternative if you don’t need an enclosure

### Voron

- **fixed gantry CoreXY:** Voron Trident *(price varies depending on kit)*
- **moving gantry CoreXY:** Voron 2.4 *(price varies depending on kit)*

## Resin

- **open-source multi-material system:** BoxTurtle / ERCF v2 / Tradrack *(for Klipper-based printers like Vorons)*

> BoxTurtle and Tradrack seems to be much easier to put together than ERCF, but your mileage may vary. I have never used either.

## Software
