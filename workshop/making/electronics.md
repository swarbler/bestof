## Precision Tools

- **precision screwdriver** 
	- **budget:** Jakemy *(see Aliexpress, Taobao, etc.)*

	- **better:** iFixit 
		- *$9 for driver only*
		- *$19 for Moray Driver Kit (32 bits)*
		- *$49 for Mako Driver Kit (64 bits)*
		- *$69 for Manta Driver Kit (112 bits)*
		- *$74 for Pro Tech Toolkit (64 bits + other tools like spudgers, suction cups, etc.)*
	- **electric:** Xiaomi *($46)*
- **spudger:** Jakemy *($6)*
- **mini rotary tool** 
	- **corded:** Dremel 4300 *($124)*
	- **cordless:** Dremel 8250 *(~~$149~~ $131)* or 8260 *($169)*

> The LTT precision screwdriver *($29 for driver only, $49 incl. 60 bits)* is a bit more expensive than the iFixit, but includes a spinny fidget with ceramic bearings and a bit compartment. Purchase if you like LTT and want to support them

> The 8250 and 8260 are very similar, but the 8260 has Bluetooth functionality with an app + an all-black design with a light-up logo. Besides the smart features, there is little to differentiate the 8260 from the 8250.
> 
> Some people online say that the app is terrible and that the light-up logo is gimmicky, but I have not tested this myself so I cannot confirm this.
